## Problem assigned


Zain lives in an old house for almost 1 year. His financial situation improved over that period and he decided to migrate to a better house. His friend Saad advised him to head over to a new website called BAYTI since it provides an easy way to search for rented houses globally. However, the current website allows users to search for houses and filter the result by price only. He opened an issue to the customer services advising them to add more filters including the rental duration, contract type, location, rating, and house quality.

# Problem 1

Suppose your manager assigned a task for you. You're required to develop a filter-based solution for clients in order to find their dream house quickly and easily. 

> Notes

1. Testing is a must!
2. It's not required to work on implementing front-end UI since your colleges will handle that.
3. Provide clear documentation for your way of thinking and code.
4. Keep in mind that new filters might be added very frequently to the website. So proof that your filters implementation is actually scalable and flexible.
5. Preferred to use Laravel framework as back-end side.



## 1. Testing ....

To run the app in local machine please 
-> clone the project in local server in commandline
```
clone https://github.com/amanullah-1/bayti.git
```
and configure the .env file as per your local database configuration

-> run the migration
```
php artisan migrate
```

and run seeder 
```
php artisan tinker
```
and then 
```
factory(\App\House::class, 100)->create()
```

(or just import the sql file given here: https://github.com/amanullah-1/bayti/blob/master/database/bayti2.sql)

For running the test run following in the command line

```
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/HouseTest.php
```

to see the working demo for the required search filter app visit: 

basic hose liting without any filter:  

http://amanullah.xyz/houses

we can check various filter configuration for e.g: 

http://amanullah.xyz/houses?price=3000

http://amanullah.xyz/houses?contract_type=Deposit-3-plus-1-month&rating=4&price=3000

and as many combination as we want from the field list of the output json.

## 2. UI ....

UI is avoided as per guided here.

## 3.Way of thinking and code

#Problem
The problem is that we will encounter with a set of filters that we must check for a lot of conditions to add to the query.

Writing a lot of terms will surely reduce the readability of our code and slow down the development process.

Also, we can only use the filters and terms in the same scope and they will not be reusable.

#Solution
We must Refactor our code! To solve this problem, we need to Refactor our code by replacing many of our conditionals with Polymorphism(Abstract Calss and/or Interface).

Here is the design pattern is explained:

## 4. scalableity and flexibality
The approach applied here is more scalable and fleibale as per expalined.
Also index in iplemented in the houses table migration for easch search input field.

## 5. Laravel

I used the laravel 5.7 here for this application.
